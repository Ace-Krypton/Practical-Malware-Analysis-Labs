This details reverse engineering activities and answers for labs contained in the book ‘Practical Malware Analysis’ by Michael Sikorski, and Andrew Honig, which is published by No Starch Press. This is a very informative book to learn about malware analysis and comes with a number of binaries to test your reverse engineering skills. I would thoroughly recommend purchasing this book.
