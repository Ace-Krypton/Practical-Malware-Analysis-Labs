File Name: Lab01-02.exe
File Type: PE32

1-> Upload the Lab01-02.exe file to http://www.VirusTotal.com/. Does it match any existing antivirus definitions?

- 53/72 detection rate


2-> Are there any indications that this file is packed or obfuscated? If so, what are these indicators? If the file is packed, unpack it if possible.

- Diving in with a different tool called Exeinfo PE, we are able to determine that this file is packed using the Ultimate Packer for eXecutables (UPX). This also gives me some information on how to unpack the executable using UPX.


3-> Do any imports hint at this program’s functionality? If so, which imports are they and what do they tell you?

- WININET.dll = The Windows Internet (WinINet) application programming interface (API) enables your application to interact with FTP and HTTP protocols to access Internet resources. As standards evolve, these functions handle the changes in underlying protocols, enabling them to maintain consistent behavior.
|
|-> InternetOpenA = Initializes an application's use of the WinINet functions.


- Advapi32.dll = It is a part of the advanced API services library. It provides access to advanced functionality that comes in addition to the kernel. It is responsible for things like the Windows registry, restarting and shutting down the system, starting/stopping and creating Windows services, and managing user accounts.
|
|-> CreateServiveA = Creates a service object and adds it to the specified service control manager database.

Based on this we can infer that the executable creates and triggers a service, and that it connects to the internet.


4-> What host or network-based indicators could be used to identify this malware on infected machines?

- Based on strings results we can assume that searching hosts for the scheduled service called ‘malservice’ and looking at any hosts connectiong to ‘http://www.malwareanalysisbook.com’ would serve as reliable host and network indicators.
