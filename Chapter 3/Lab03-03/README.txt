File Type: PE32

1-> What do you notice when monitoring this malware with Process Explorer?
- If we monitor this malware with Process Explorer we can see it briefly spawns svchost before both processes vanish.
- At this point if we look closer into the memory strings of running svchost processes, 
- we can see that this malware has used process replacement (more commonly known as process hollowing nowadays) to execute under the guise of a svchost process.


2-> Can you identify any live memory modifications?
- As mentioned by looking into the live memory of svchost we can see the strings differ significantly on disk to what is in memory.


3-> What are the malware’s host-based indicators?
- We can see both in memory, and on disk that the malware creates a file called practicalmalwareanalysis.log


4-> What is the purpose of this program?
- By opening wordpad and typing out some content, we can then open up practicalmalwareanalysis.log and see that it has logged all of our keystrokes.
- From this we can conclude that this uses process hollowing to run a keylogger on the infected machine through svchost.exe
