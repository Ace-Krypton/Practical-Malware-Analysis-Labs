1-> What happens when you run this file?
- When we run this file it immediately deletes itself. 
- We can see this event coming from the program spawning a del (delete) command from a command prompt.


2-> What is causing the roadblock in dynamic analysis?
- This could be caused by command line parameters needing to be passed to the program, 
- it is needing to fetch a particular file from a remote location, 
- it detecting it is in a sandbox, 
- it only targeting a particular timezone, 
- or it only running on a specific domain. 
- Some clues can be found by looking at the program strings.
- Strings
